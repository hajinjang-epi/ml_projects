# ml_projects

This repository contains applied statistical and machine learning projects using real-world health and population data.

Across projects, I focus on end-to-end analytical workflows, including research question formulation, data preprocessing, model implementation, and evaluation. The work emphasizes comparing multiple modeling approaches and balancing predictive performance with interpretability, particularly in epidemiologic and public health contexts.

Methods covered include classification and regression, regularization (LASSO and Ridge), tree-based models, generalized additive models with splines, dimensionality reduction, and clustering. Projects are implemented primarily in R and are designed to reflect realistic modeling challenges encountered in applied research settings.
